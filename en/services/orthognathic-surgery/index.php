<p>
	 Orthognathic surgery is the direction of dentistry, the main task of which is the correction of occlusion (tooth ratio) through intervention in the maxillofacial region.
</p>
<p>
	 Orthognathic surgery is leprosy in the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>with changes in the dentition, which are caused by a violation of the formation of bones of the facial skeleton;</li>
	<li>with deformation of the dentition, which is caused by a violation of the growth and development of bones of the facial skeleton;</li>
	<li>with severe asymmetry of the face due to imbalances in the anatomical features of the jaw;</li>
	<li>in case of excessive development of the lower jaw, which entails a violation of the harmonious appearance of the face;</li>
	<li>in case of underdevelopment of the jaws;</li>
	<li>in the case when the orthodontic treatment did not bring or cannot bring the proper results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Orthognathic Surgery Results</h2>
<p>
	 Through professional orthognathic intervention, it is possible to effectively correct a malocclusion and acquire the correct facial profile, thereby improving the quality of life. Moreover, patients get rid of speech defects, problems with eating, and as a result, digestive problems. The best results of treatment can be achieved only through close interaction of the maxillofacial surgeon and the orthodontist.
