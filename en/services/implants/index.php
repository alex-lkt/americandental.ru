?><p>Dental implants â€“ teeth that look and feel like your own.</p>

<p>Dental implants are changing the way people live! They are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth which look, feel, and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved.</p>


<p>Dental implants are one of the greatest advances in modern dentistry. Dental implants manufactured from titanium and represent tooth-like shaped fixtures (endoosseuos implants). Implants are placed into the bone where natural teeth have been lost. Years of research and clinical data have proven 97% success rate for most endooseous dental implants. In many clinical cases dental implants maybe superior to the natural teeth in terms of strength, reliability and durability. Implants can be easier to clean, have better aesthetical appearance and becoming the preferred choice of patients for replacing missing teeth.</p>

<p>The most common approach to place implant includes three stages:</p>

	
<h3>Stage I</h3>
<p>The gum is flapped open and a site is prepared in the bone. The <a href="/en/implant/">implant</a> is placed and the gum is sutured closed over it for 3 or more months to allow time for the bone to grow into the textured surface of the implant.</p>

	
<h3>Stage II</h3>
<p>The top of the implant is reaccessed through the gum and an abutment is placed - extending the implant through the gum.</p>

	
<h3>Stage III</h3>
<p>When healing is judged to be satisfactory and the tissues around the implant are healthy, a crown matching the natural teeth is made and cemented in place. It looks and works like a natural tooth!</p>

<p>Under proper conditions, such as placement by a periodontist and diligent patient maintenance, implants can last a lifetime and serve as your own teeth.</p><?require($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"].SITE_TEMPLATE_PATH."/fixedwidth-footer.php"); require($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/bitrix/footer.php");?>
