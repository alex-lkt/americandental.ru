<p>
	Periodontitis is one of the most common causes of tooth loss after 40 years: in 4 out of 5 cases, tooth loss is the result of a number of periodontal diseases. Such diseases are provoked by the accumulation of dental deposits, often they are painless and progress rapidly. The optimal solution for the prevention of periodontitis and other periodontal diseases is a regular visit to the dentist.
</p>
<p>
	In order to avoid periodontal diseases, it is necessary to observe the rules of oral hygiene and undergo periodic examinations by the dentist (preferably once every 5-6 months). Professional toothbrushing is the best prevention, however, if periodontitis has already overtaken you, then deep brushing is necessary.
</p>
<p>
	Gingivitis and periodontitis are destructive periodontal processes, which are a chronic infection that provokes the development of inflammatory processes in the gums and bone tissue of the jaw. It is almost impossible to diagnose periodontitis and gingivitis in the early stages on their own, because these diseases initially practically do not bring discomfort, but progress quickly, which entails the destruction of the soft tissues surrounding the tooth, as well as the jaw bone. As a result, the patient may lose a tooth.
</p>
<p>
	Clinical manifestations of periodontal disease - the formation of periodontal pockets. Normally, the depth of the dentition pocket does not exceed 3 mm, however, with the formation of a periodontal pocket, the size of the slit-like space between the tooth surface and the gum can be more than 8 mm. In such cases, the tooth is almost impossible to save, it must be removed. If you notice swelling, redness and bleeding of the gums, bad breath, a certain mobility of the teeth or a change in the bite - this is an occasion to immediately contact a dentist.
</p>
<p>
	Periodontitis has 3 stages of development:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>gingivitis;</li>
	<li>
	mild periodontitis;</li>
	<li>
	progressive periodontitis.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Gingivitis is an intermediate stage of the development of periodontitis, it is characterized by the following symptoms: swelling of the gums, redness, bleeding during brushing. Such symptoms may not cause suspicion, which is why there is a huge risk of starting a disease. After some time, plaque can spread below the gum border area, bacteria will accumulate in the periodontal groove. As a result of the products of the vital activity of bacteria, the mucous membrane of the gums will undergo a protective process, which will manifest itself as severe or moderate inflammation. Thus, the body will give an immune response to the action of infectious agents. However, over time, soft and hard tissues soften, and will no longer be able to fully provide high-quality support for the tooth, the formation of a pathological gingival pocket, which is also called the periodontal canal. In the process of progression of periodontitis, the size of the channel will become more and more, contributing to the destruction of the tissues of the supporting apparatus of the tooth and the tooth itself. Even at this stage, the symptoms are often ignored, since they do not bring significant discomfort, however, in some cases, even then there is a need to remove the tooth.

<p>
	To prevent the development of periodontitis will help to regularly check the condition of the periodontium. In addition, during the study, the dentist will be able to identify other gum diseases and bone atrophy. Turning to our dental center, you get advice from a periodontist on your first visit, because it is the health of the gums that determines the state of the oral cavity and the entire body.
</p>
<p>
	If you have already encountered gingivitis or periodontitis, then our periodontist will be able to recommend surgical treatment that is performed to restore the affected tissue and preserve the tooth.
</p>
<p>
	There are several varieties of periodontal treatment:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>gingival curettage;</li>
	<li>
	patchwork operation;</li>
	<li>
	targeted tissue regeneration;</li>
	<li>
	elongation of the crown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gingival curettage</h2>
<p>
	If periodontal disease is detected in the early stages, surgery can be avoided. Enough complex drug therapy consisting of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drugs, rinses. Deep tooth brushing (gingival curettage) eliminates dental deposits 100% above the gum level, after which subsequent periodontal canals are treated with a number of medications in order to create optimal conditions for tissue regeneration and healing.
</p>

<h2>Patchwork operation</h2>
<p>
	Patchwork is performed in 2 stages: dissection of the gum tissue, followed by cleaning of the periodontal pockets and tooth surface. Intervention is performed under local anesthesia. Removal of dental deposits is performed using curettes or skeletons, the root surface is polished, after which the dentist strengthens the previously cut off mucous flaps.
