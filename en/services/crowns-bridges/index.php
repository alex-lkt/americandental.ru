?><p>The crown of a tooth is the portion that is covered by enamel. A restorative crown replaces this outer part to protect the tooth. This protection becomes necessary when a tooth cracks or has its entire structure weakened by decay.</p>

<p>As with a filling or inlay, the dentist first removes the decayed portion of the tooth. The tooth is then prepared for a crown. It also may needto be reinforced with a cast core and a post. A wax impression of the prepared tooth and the teeth next to it is made. The new crown is made to fit this mold. The crown may be made of gold or stainless steel alone, metal with a veneer of tooth-colored porcelain or resin, or of porcelain or resin alone. The finished crown is then placed over the prepared tooth, adjusted, and cemented into place.</p>

<p>In our center we use the technology of making porcelain-metal crowns with a porcelain shoulder. It means that metal cannot be seen at the edge of the crown and it totally imitates natural tooth structure. Our clinicians work in cooparation with highly skilled technicians and produce best quality restorations in cooperation with them. </p>

<p>Bridges are a type of restoration that is done when one or more permanent teeth are lost or pulled. The resulting gap must be filled in to prevent the remaining teeth from shifting. If the other teeth shift, they will affect the patient's bite (occlusion), which sometimes produces pain in the jaw joint. As the teeth move and become crooked, they also become more difficult to keep clean. The risk of tooth decay and gum disease increases, increasing the likelihood that additional teeth will be lost. A bridge is inserted to prevent this risk.</p>


<p>Bridges are nonremovable appliances of one or more artificial teeth (pontics) anchored by crowns on the adjacent teeth (abutment teeth). The abutment teeth carry the pressure when the patient chews food.</p><?require($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"].SITE_TEMPLATE_PATH."/fixedwidth-footer.php"); require($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/bitrix/footer.php");?>
