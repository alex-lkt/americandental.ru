<p>Veneers are magical change: damaged teeth , imperfect teeth, discolorized theeth, tooth arche with gaps between – veneers create ideal smile! There's no reason to put up with gaps in your teeth or with teeth that are stained, badly shaped or crooked. Today a veneer placed on top of your teeth can correct nature's mistake or the results of an injury and help you have a beautiful smile.</p>

<p>Modern porcelain veneers are thin, custom-made shells crafted of tooth-colored ceramics designed to cover the front side of teeth. They're made by a dental technician, usually in a dental lab, working from a model provided by your dentist.</p>


<p>All-ceramic crowns are also made to hide defects of natural teeth but unlike veneers they cover the whole crown of the tooth. Ceramic crowns are also made in the dental lab and have no metal base which can bee seen through the ceramic layer in the straigh light beams. Therefore all-ceramic crowns is a good choice for restorations in the front group of teeth.</p>

<p>They are usually made when a great part of the front tooth is damaged or destroyed by caries from both front and lingual/palatal sides and cover tooth like a cap. It is also a means of choice in the case of bruksism because ceramic is harder than natutal tooth tissue and doesn not undergo abrasion.</p>
