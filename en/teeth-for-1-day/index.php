	 The “Teeth in a Day” implantation is performed using the <a href="/en/all-on-4/">All-on-4</a> and <a href="/en/all-on-6/">All-on-6</a> technologies using zygomatic implants. This implantation method provides for the restoration of all missing teeth using a fixed bridge on the implants, immediately on the day of surgery.<br>
</p>
<p>
	 Implantation using the "Teeth in a Day" technology in our center is carried out by a highly qualified American dentist Vladimir Valerievich Soyfer, who has more than 25 years of clinical experience with the Nobel Branemark System, which is confirmed by the corresponding certificate.
</p>
<p>
	 The "Teeth in One Day" method is suitable for you if:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>all available teeth must be removed, or teeth are already missing;</li>
	<li>previously installed removable dentures need to be replaced or repaired.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The main advantages of the technology "Teeth in 1 day"</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You can perform tooth extraction and prosthetics in 1 day;</li>
	<li>The cost of implantation will pleasantly surprise you;</li>
	<li>The terms of treatment are much shorter than with traditional approaches;</li>
</ul>

	 Immediate restoration of the functions and aesthetics of the teeth: the prosthesis is installed directly on the day of the operation, which means that there is no need for a long time to wait for the complete restoration and healing of the surgical wound, the integration of implants with surrounding tissues, etc.
</p>
<p>
	 Economic benefits: there is no need for expensive and complex procedures such as bone grafting and sinus lifting.
</p>
<p>
	 Comfort and durability of prosthetics: we guarantee long-term service of the prosthesis and comfort when wearing it. You definitely will not encounter problems that arise with prolonged use of removable plastic dentures. In addition, you do not have to wait for wounds to heal after tooth extraction, because implants can be installed immediately.
</p>
<p>
	 Implantation "Teeth in 1 day" is carried out in several stages:
</p>
<p>
	 First of all, the doctor provides a consultation, during which he examines the oral cavity and draws up a treatment plan.
</p>
<p>
	 A study of the state of bone tissue using the method of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
</p>
<p>
	 The implants are being installed.
</p>
<p>
	 The load is applied using a fixed bridge structure.
</p>
<h3>Features of the technology "Teeth in 1 day"</h3>
<p>
	 Implants should be installed at an appropriate angle in such a way as to ensure maximum stability and even distribution of the load.
</p>
<p>
	 The installation of a bridge eliminates any problems associated with its displacement.
</p>
<p>
	 The prosthesis looks exactly like natural teeth, has high functionality and special comfort.
</p>
<p>
	 “Teeth in 1 day” is an immediate solution for prosthetics of missing teeth, which can be implemented even in the absence of bone tissue (which is an unacceptable factor for the application of traditional approaches). You can chew and smile just a few hours after you leave the doctor’s office. Immediate improvement in quality of life: You immediately get aesthetics, restoration of masticatory functions and speech.
