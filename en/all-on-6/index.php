		<h1>Implantation ALL-ON-6</h1>

		<p>
			 All-on-6 implantation is an implantation method, the main feature of which is the installation of a bridge structure on six implants that serve as a support. The prosthesis itself can include up to 14 artificial teeth. The main advantages of the All-on-6 implantation are its affordable cost, reliability guarantee, and the ability to perform prosthetics in 1 day. The procedure is performed by a certified American doctor - Vladimir Valerievich Soyfer, whose qualifications are confirmed by Nobel Branemark System USA.
		</p>
		<h2>Indications for implantation "All-on-6"</h2>
		<p>
			 This implantation method is suitable for those patients who have completely missing teeth, or for patients with badly damaged teeth that must be removed (including as a result of periodontitis). The All-on-6 implantation protocol can be carried out in the presence of inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity, as well as for smokers (unlike traditional implantation methods). The determining factor in the possibility of implantation using the All-on-Six technology is the results of the study of bone tissue by the method of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), after which the doctor can draw up the correct treatment plan.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Key Features of the All-on-Six Implantation Protocol:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The bridge is supported by six implants;</li>
			<li>In the frontal part of the jaw, implants should be installed vertically, while in the lateral parts - at an angle of no more than 45 degrees, in order to prevent damage to the anatomical structures of the jaw;</li>
			<li>The ability to give an immediate load.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Which method to choose: All-on-4 or All-on-6</h3>
		 <img src="/upload/medialibrary/7c8/7c885e1e2c1ced7025ddce4667fef511.jpg" alt="Which method to choose: All-on-4 or All-on-6" title="Which method to choose: All-on-4 or All-on-6" class="img-r">
		<p>
			 There is a huge difference between the All-on-4 and All-on-6 protocols, it is not only in the number of support implants on which the bridge is mounted. The main feature of the All-on-6 protocol is the possibility of its implementation with moderate bone atrophy, in contrast to the All-on-4 technology, which is shown to patients only with a slight loss of bone.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Installation of implants is performed at the same time with the extraction of teeth, and the implants themselves are installed directly in the wells of the extracted teeth.
		</p>
		<p>
			 During the installation, all layers of the bone are involved, including the zygomatic bone and buttresses of the jaw, thanks to which we are able to achieve very high primary stability of the implants.
		</p>
		<p>
			 However, a key feature of the All-on-6 technology is the possibility of using Zygomatic implants, which are a single unit with an angled abutment installed in the zygomatic bone. Fixation of the prosthesis itself is performed 2-3 days after implantation.
